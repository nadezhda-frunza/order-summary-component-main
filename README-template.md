### Continued development

Spent too much time figuring out what was wrong with the background image, why it doesn't apply. And it is still too big.
forgot about img element for hero image;
Also divs is my weak point - keep forgetting where to put them and which parts I close with them.
It started to become cumbersome and repetitive when I styled the buttons. So I remembered that I can assign two classes to one css element and thus making a common class between two buttons.
For some reason assigning flex direction: column on buttons wouldn't let me center the text.
Used this video instruction https://youtube.com/shorts/GLB-JTYfa8M?feature=share just to do something instead of queries. but it didn't work.
